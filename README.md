# Navigation Bar

This repository contains an HTML document that displays a navigation bar with four links. The navigation bar features smooth hover effects and a clean, modern design.

## Features

- **Navigation Links**: The navigation bar includes four links - Home, About, Gallery, and Contact.
- **Hover Effects**: When the user hovers over the links, the background color changes to red and the text color changes to black, with smooth transition effects.
- **Centered Layout**: The navigation bar is centered and aligned horizontally.

## How It Works

### HTML Structure:
- The navigation bar is contained within a `div` with the class `con`.
- Each link (`a` tag) is wrapped inside the container and points to placeholder `#` links for demonstration purposes.
  
### CSS Styling:
- **Navigation Bar Layout**: The `.con` class uses flexbox to center the links both horizontally and vertically within the container.
- **Link Styling**: Links are styled to be white with no text decoration, and they have a bold font with letter spacing.
- **Hover Effects**: When hovering over the links, the background color changes to red, and the text color switches to black with padding applied around the link. The hover effect includes a smooth transition with a duration of 0.8 seconds.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure for the navigation bar.
- **CSS**: Styling for the navigation bar and hover effects.

## Usage

## Limitations

- **Static Links**: The links are currently placeholders (`#`). Replace them with actual URLs for your site.
- **No Responsive Design**: The current design is fixed and may require adjustments for responsiveness (e.g., mobile-friendly views).
